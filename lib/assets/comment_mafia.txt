Next time you come in here, you come heavy..or not at all.  

Who the fuck cares? I'll dig the fuckin' hole. I don't give a fuck. What is it, the first hole I dug? Not the first time I dug a hole. I'll fuckin' dig a hole. Where are the shovels?  

Stupid I-tai, bring a knife to a gun fight. 

If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. 

You wanna fuck with me? Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!  

When I introduce you, I'm gonna say, 'This is a friend of mine.' That means you're a connected guy. Now if I said instead, 'This is a friend of ours', that would mean you a made guy. A Capiche? 

If a guy fucking tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it. 
 
You can get further with a kind word and a gun than you can with just a kind word.

I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. 

Make a wish... it'll be your last
